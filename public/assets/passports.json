			"text":"A compelling mix of artefacts, video, and interactive displays tells the newcomers’ moving stories – from the cramped steerage on board an 1840s sailing ship, to fearful flight from war-torn Europe, and more recent voyages into the unknown down under. The cultural richness and diversity of the regional lifestyles of British and Irish migrants are screened on video and maps. Images of other regions, including China, India, Dalmatia, Greece, and the Pacific tell of other regional lifestyles. The Mixing Room: Stories from young refugees in New Zealand explores the extraordinary stories of 70 recent migrants to New Zealand through art, film, poetry, and performance. The Mixing Room exhibition is in our Community Gallery, Level 4, located near Passports."
