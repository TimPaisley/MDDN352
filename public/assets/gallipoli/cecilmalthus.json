His huge, hunched back confronts visitors leaving the stories of evacuation from Gallipoli. He is fully laden with his soldierâ€™s kit. His eyes gaze into the darkness of the next three years on the Western Front. The shell-pit he trudges through is now filling with red paper poppies left by visitors.",
