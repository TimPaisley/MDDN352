Then journey through New Zealand’s rapid transformation, from forests and wetlands to gardens, farms, and settlements, hearing a haunting lament for the species that became extinct as a result. You can even settle a new land yourself. In our ‘Survivor’ computer interactive you’ll become an alien and choose species to take from your planet to a new one – will you survive?"

Uncover the rich meaning behind beautiful taongataonga Māori cultural treasures such as ipu whenua (afterbirth containers), rākau whakapapa (genealogy staffs), and a striking display of matau (fish hooks and lures), along with a dazzling interactive on the maramataka (Māori lunar calendar)."
